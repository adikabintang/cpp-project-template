C++ Project Template

This template uses make/ninja as a build tool. However, the Makefile or the ninja build file is generated by CMake. Therefore, make sure that gcc/g++, make, ninja-build, and cmake are installed. It is also recommended to use gcc > 5 and CMake > 3.

This template is heavily influenced by the template that PlatformIO recommend. However, a small addition are made such as the test and the third_party dir.
