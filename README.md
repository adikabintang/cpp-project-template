C++ Project Template

This template uses make/ninja as a build tool. However, the Makefile or the ninja build file is generated by CMake. Therefore, make sure that gcc/g++, make, ninja-build, and cmake are installed. It is also recommended to use gcc > 5 and CMake > 3.

This template is heavily influenced by the template that PlatformIO recommends. However, some additions are made such as the test and the third_party dir.

To use this program, follow these steps:
1. Create a "build" folder (mkdir build), then go to that folder (cd build)
2. Create the Makefile (cmake ..) or the ninja file (cmake .. -G Ninja). Choose only one between them.
3. Build the code. If you use make: (make -j4), if you use ninja: (ninja). The "-j4" that follows the make command is used to specify the number of cores assigned to compile the program, which is 4 cores. Ninja does not need this because it uses all cores available by default.
4. Go to the root project folder (cd ..) then go to bin folder (cd bin). Your program is here.
5. To clean the build files and bin file, simply go to build folder and use "make clean" or "ninja clean".
